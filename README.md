An analysis tool for Python that blurs the line between testing and 
type systems.

> **_THE LATEST NEWS:_**  
[Marko Ristin] just published an early VS Code extension for CrossHair!
Install it from the [VS Code Marketplace].

If you have a function with
[type annotations](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) and add a
contract
[in a supported syntax](https://crosshair.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kinds_of_contracts.html),
CrossHair will attempt to find counterexamples for you:

CrossHair works by repeatedly calling your functions with symbolic inputs.
It uses an [SMT solver] (a kind of theorem prover) to explore viable 
execution paths and find counterexamples for you.
This is not a new idea; an approach for Python was first described in
[this paper].
However, to my knowledge, CrossHair is the most complete implementation of 
the idea: it supports symbolic lists, dictionaries, sets, and even symbolic
instances of your own classes.
