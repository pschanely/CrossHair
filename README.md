An analysis tool for Python that blurs the line between testing and
type systems.

> **_THE LATEST NEWS:_**
Python's most popular property-based testing tool,
[Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
now supports running CrossHair as an
[optional backend](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/strategies.html#alternative-backends)!


If you have a function with
[type annotations](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) and add a
contract
[in a supported syntax](https://crosshair.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kinds_of_contracts.html),
CrossHair will attempt to find counterexamples for you:

CrossHair works by repeatedly calling your functions with symbolic inputs.
It uses an [SMT solver] (a kind of theorem prover) to explore viable
execution paths and find counterexamples for you.
This is not a new idea; a Python approach was first described in
[this paper].
However, to my knowledge, CrossHair is the most complete implementation:
it can use symbolic reasoning for the built-in types, user-defined classes, and much
of the standard library.

CrossHair has [IDE integrations] for [VS Code], [PyCharm], and more.

Finally, CrossHair can do more than check contracts. It can also
[generate unit tests](https://crosshair.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cover.html)
and
[find behavioral differences](https://crosshair.readthedocs.io/en/latest/diff_behavior.html)
between functions.
