    """
    A heuristic that attempts to target under-explored code locations.

    Code condition counts:
        {code pos: {condition => count}}
        Conditions should be
            a count of conditions
            that lead to the code location
            on some previously explored path

    When beginning an iteration:
        Pick a code location to target, biasing for those with few visits.
        Bias our decisions based on piror ones that led to the target location.

    Risks:
        *   Coupled decisions aren't understood, e.g. "a xor b" is challenging with underexplored
            leaves in both branches.
        *   We may target code locations that are impossible to reach because we've exhausted
            every path that leads to them. (TODO: visit frequency may not be the only appropriate
            metric for selecting target locations)
        *   Biases for now-impossible branches "bleed" over into our path.
            This sounds like a problem, but is at least partly intentional - we may hope to reach
            some of the same code locations under different early decisions.
