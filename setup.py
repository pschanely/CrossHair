# Do not forget to update and sync the fields in crosshair/__init__.py!
#
# (mristin, 2021-02-05): It is almost impossible to refer to the
# crosshair/__init__.py from within setup.py as the source distribution will
# run setup.py while installing the package.
# That is why we can not be DRY here and need to sync manually.

# The fields between crosshair/__init__.py and this file are checked as part of
# the pre-commit checks through check_init_and_setup_coincide.py.
