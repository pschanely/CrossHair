Coordinate First
================

Before you create a pull request, please `create a new issue`_ first 
or check in on `gitter`_ to coordinate.

It might be that we are already working on the same or similar feature, but we 
haven't made our work visible yet.

.. _create a new issue: https://github.com/pschanely/CrossHair/issues/new/choose
.. _gitter: https://gitter.im/Cross_Hair/Lobby

Create a Development Environment
================================

We usually develop in a `virtual environment`_.
To create one, change to the root directory of the repository and invoke:

.. code-block::

    python -m venv venv


You need to activate it. On *nix (Linux, Mac, *etc.*):

.. code-block::

    source venv/bin/activate

and on Windows:

.. code-block::

    venv\Scripts\activate

.. _virtual environment: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html

Install Development Dependencies
================================

Once you activated the virtual environment, you can install the development 
dependencies using ``pip``:

.. code-block::

    pip3 install --editable .[dev]

The `--editable <pip-editable_>`_ option is necessary so that all the changes
made to the repository are automatically reflected in the virtual environment 
(see also `this StackOverflow question <pip-editable-stackoverflow_>`_).

.. _pip-editable-stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35064426/when-would-the-e-editable-option-be-useful-with-pip-install

Pre-commit Checks
=================

We provide a battery of pre-commit checks to make the code uniform and 
consistent across the code base.

We use `black`_ to format the code and use the default maximum line length of
88 characters.

.. _black: https://pypi.org/project/black/

The docstrings need to conform to `PEP 257`_.
We use `Sphinx docstring format`_ to mark special fields (such as function
arguments, return values *etc.*).
Please annotate your function with type annotations instead of writing the types
in the docstring. 

.. _PEP 257: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/
.. _Sphinx docstring format: https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html

To run all pre-commit checks, run from the root directory:

.. code-block::

    python precommit.py

You can automatically re-format the code with:

.. code-block::

    python precommit.py --overwrite

Here is the full manual of the pre-commit script:

.. Help starts: python precommit.py --help
.. code-block:: text

    usage: precommit.py [-h] [--overwrite] [--select  [...]] [--skip  [...]]

    Run pre-commit checks on the repository.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help        show this help message and exit
      --overwrite       Try to automatically fix the offending files (e.g., by re-
                        formatting).
      --select  [ ...]  If set, only the selected steps are executed. This is
                        practical if some of the steps failed and you want to fix
                        them in isolation. The steps are given as a space-
                        separated list of: black flake8 pydocstyle mypy doctest
                        check-init-and-setup-coincide check-help-in-doc test
      --skip  [ ...]    If set, skips the specified steps. This is practical if
                        some of the steps passed and you want to fix the remainder
                        in isolation. The steps are given as a space-separated
                        list of: black flake8 pydocstyle mypy doctest check-init-
                        and-setup-coincide check-help-in-doc test

.. Help ends: python precommit.py --help


The pre-commit script also runs as part of our continuous integration pipeline.

Write Commit Message
====================

We follow Chris Beams' `guidelines on commit messages`_:

1) Separate subject from body with a blank line
2) Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3) Capitalize the subject line
4) Do not end the subject line with a period
5) Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6) Wrap the body at 72 characters
7) Use the body to explain *what* and *why* vs. *how*
