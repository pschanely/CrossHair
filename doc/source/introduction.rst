CrossHair is an analysis tool for Python that blurs the line between testing and
type systems.

If you have a function with `type annotations`_ and add a
contract :ref:`in a supported kind of contracts <Kinds of Contracts>`,
CrossHair will attempt to find counterexamples for you:

CrossHair works by repeatedly calling your functions with symbolic inputs.
It uses an `SMT solver`_ (a kind of theorem prover) to explore viable execution
paths and find counterexamples for you.
This is not a new idea; an approach for Python was first described in
`this paper`_.
However, to my knowledge, CrossHair is the most complete implementation of the
idea: it supports symbolic lists, dictionaries, sets, and
custom mutable objects.
